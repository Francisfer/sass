<!-- 

  We are starting this project by defining the basic settings just like we did with natours. We are also going to learn how and why to use custom properties in css instead of sass variables.

  In terms of architecture, we are not going to create as many folders as we did in the last project, we will have three simple files, one for the base settings, one for the overall layout of the app and one for the smaller components. (the partials that we import to the main.scss)

  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
  Don't forget how the imports are made.
  @import "base";
  @import "components";
  @import "layout";

  <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

  The global reset.

      * {
      margin: 0;
      padding: 0;
    }

    html {
      font-size: 62.5%; 1rem = 10px / 16px = 62.5%
      box-sizing: border-box;
    }

    *,
    *::before,
    *::after {
      box-sizing: inherit;
    }
    body {
      The values for the overall document.
      font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif;
      font-weight: 400;
      line-height: 1.6;

       
      min-height: 100vh; the min is 100 but it can grow
      max-width: 120rem - the max is 120, but it can shrink if there is not enough space to display 120rem.
    }

    <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

    Custom css properties/variables

    This means that we can use variables in css and don't have to rely on sass variables. 
    The first reason why this is better is that, with css variables, we don't even need a css pre-processor, THIS in the case that we are just using sass for the variables.

    The second advantage is that css variables can be manipulated in Javascript and we can also edit them in our dev tools. They are also easier to use in the calc function, they cascade and are inherited.

    We must define the variables inside a scope (code block), we could write these variables inside any selector that we want, however, they would only be available in that element and it's children. 
    This is not a good strategy because we want these variables to be accessible in the entire document, so we define them in the root pseudo element.

    The root pseudo element is essentially the html selector but with a higher specificity.

          :root {
            
              --color-primary: #eb2f64;
              --color-primary-light: #ff3366;
              --color-primary-dark: #ba265d;
      }

  1. Why to use svg icons vs font icons?
  Remember that we've used font icons in the previous project in order to change their color as they are treated as text.
  There are several problems with icon fonts: it is just a hack to display icons (which are like images using a font), they fail very often and they don't work with screen readers.

  The better alternative to this is to use svg. Scalable vector graphics are just a way of writing vector graphics with code.

  2. How to find, generate and use svg sprites in html.

  We are not going to write svg but we are going to use a resource like iconmoon.io RESOURCE
  There are several free packages, but we are going to use entypo+.
  From there we just select the ones that we need, generate svg and more and unselect png (we just want svg). Also pay attention to the prefix.

  After downloading we just need two files, the svg folder and the sprite file (symbol-defs.svg).
  The sprite is an svg file that contains all of the svg images that we've downloaded. This is the one that we are going to use because it is just one file from which we can select all the icons (one http request).

  The demo html file is useful so we can see the names of the icons more easily.

  As for the usage, we use the svg tag and give it a class that we want, then in there, the use tag with the xlink:href="path of the sprite# name of the icon". the hash is the id.

  This is the best way of using svg in html, however this only works on a server, so there might be a problem if we use them on static sites with other types of hosting. IMPORTANT


  3. How to change the color of an svg icon in css.
  With this way of including the svg in the html we can change the color in css just by using the fill property.

  4. How to use more advanced flexbox alignment techniques like justify-content, align-items, align-self and flex.

<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

  1. How to use scale y and multiple transition properties with different settings, to create a creative hover effect.

  Always remember the transform origin (center by default)

  the z index only works if we have a specified position.

  transition: transform 0.2s, width 0.4s cubic-bezier(1, 0, 0, 1) 0.2s,
      background-color 0.1s

  2. How and why to use the currentColor css variable.
  fill: var(--color-grey-light-1); we want the same color as the link, but instead of copying it we can use currentColor. currentColor is the color of the current element or the parent element. By not specifying the color here, it means that it will get the same color specified in the parent element.

  Also very useful for the hover effects in case we change the color there.

  3. How to use some more advanced flexbox alignment techniques, including flex-direction justify-content and align-items.

  Remember that this was taught in the hotel overview part, where we had four elements to align.
  We wanted that the layout divided with space between the first and last two elements. 
  We couldn't use any of the justify content values because none of them would do this, also we couldn't stretch the stars because then if we wanted a hover effect it would select all of the space.
  One of the solution would be to wrap the first and last two elements and use space between, but there is a much better technique using margin auto.
  Remember that when we set the display of a container to flex, the flex-items will occupy all the available space of the parent. After that we can use the alignment properties in order to place them, so, if we set the margin right (ex) to auto, that margin will occupy the rest of the space available. This makes it easier that have to build the containers just to make this possible.

  

  3. Flexbox properties for easy positioning and alignment.

  2. How and why to use masks with mask-image and mask-size.
  398 to give color to an svg used as a background image in a before pseudo element. For older browsers we use background image with background size, for newer browsers we use masks.


  ///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

  Things to better understand:

  1. How the selection of the siblings is correctly done in every situation (the adjacent sibling (+) selector and the others).
  The direct children selector > (if we want all the direct children we use & > *)

  2. How the negative margin makes another element to be on top of another. (remember the magnifying glass in the search bar)

  3. Making changes on the placeholder just work with ::-webkit-input-placeholder

  4. To align, flex-box works with text also, not only when we have child elements.

  5. Pseudo elements, modifier classes 
  &__item:hover::before,
  &__item--active::before {
    transform: scaleY(1); // Same as 100%
    width: 100%; // for the expansion
  
    What the space between means, what the comma means when separating)
  }

  6. Remember that images are inline elements, so they are treated as text, just as any other element with the display set to inline. This is done because when text is added to the page, some room is made by the browser for the descender (the next text). In order to remove it we just need to set the display to block OR the display of their parent element to flex (then they become flex items). 
  Search for a better solution if we want the display to be inline-block because, in that case, the space is added. One of them is to set the line-height to 0, and, in the case of the svg, also the font-size to 0.

  7. Padding and margin.
  By default I use margin everywhere, except when I have a border or background and want to increase the space inside that visible box.

  To me, the biggest difference between padding and margin is that vertical margins auto-collapse, and padding doesn't.

  Consider two elements one above the other each with padding of 1em. This padding is considered to be part of the element and is always preserved.

  So you will end up with the content of the first element, followed by the padding of the first element, followed by the padding of the second, followed by the content of the second element.

  Thus the content of the two elements will end up being 2em apart.

  Now replace that padding with 1em margin. Margins are considered to be outside of the element, and margins of adjacent items will overlap.

  So in this example, you will end up with the content of the first element followed by 1em of combined margin followed by the content of the second element. So the content of the two elements is only 1em apart.

  This can be really useful when you know that you want to say 1em of spacing around an element, regardless of what element it is next to.

  The other two big differences are that padding is included in the click region and background color/image, but not the margin.

  8. Using svg directly in css
  When we were building the list, he shows another technique for using svg directly in css, otherwise we would have to include one eight times. 
  We have been using the sprite as a reference to just make one http request for all the svg that we use in html, but in css that is not so easy, so we need to use the single icon itself.
  In this case it does not make such a huge difference because the icon is the same for all list items, but if we needed more the best strategy should be to include them in the html. We can't change the color with fill though, we need to use MASKS.
  Notice that he copied that icon from the svg folder to the img folder. So that we can delete the svg folder because we don't need it anymore.
  When we use this technique of not including the images in the html we need to pay attention to the url or the path that we specify.

  See if there is a way to create vector icons of vector images.

  9. When we add the border, the image shrinks, that's because we set the box-sizing to border-box (includes the padding and the border into the width and height of the element).
  To fix this we have two options, either we add the 3px of the border to the height and width or we can set it automatically by changing the box sizing.
  The default is content-box, so that the border is added on top of the height and width that we establish.
