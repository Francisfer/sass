    They belong to the same block (story), but they are different elements. It is not bad practice to have the block and the element without a parent block. By the code we know that they are both part of the story but we want them to be different grid items.

    Also notice that we only use the name of the block on the elements that are not reusable. For example the h2, the h3 and the button don't have the name of the block in the class because they are independent and used all across the page.

<!-- 

1. This time the architecture has one component per part/section of the page layout. There are 8 parts in the layout that are going to be the grid items.
Must check if this is the best practice, because it will be much more easier this way.

///////////////////////////////////////////////

2. After having the markup, giving a background color to each one is very helpful.

///////////////////////////////////////////////

3. Now it's time to style the container. This is where the magic happens, we set display to grid and then start by specifying the rows.

    ROWS
    3.1 - The first row is where the header is going to be, so we want it to have 80% of the viewport height, so 80vh. This means that it is already responsive from the start.

    3.2 - The second row is for the features, it is clear that we have a grid in here too. We want this row to have the necessary height to fit the content. 
    If we add more content the row will grow with it and, also, this means that if we decrease the width, the content will adapt vertically (just like a media query, adds a row and removes a column).
    For this we want the min-content (auto is the default and it is the same as min content).

    3.3 - As for the third row (story - where we have two elements), it is not a function of the viewport height but the viewport width.
    VERY IMPORTANT - Saying that the row is not a function of the viewport height means that if we decrease the viewport width, the size of the boxes also decreases, adapting to the viewport width. 
    The header for ex only responds to the viewport height. We set this one to be 40% of the viewport width.

    3.4 - The forth, fifth and last rows are similar to the features row. We easily see that we have a grids in there as well and so we want the rows height to adapt to the content. min-content

    COLUMNS
    3.1 - It is very common in web design to use a design grid with 8, 12 or 16 predefined columns. 
    This is also what we are going to do here, although it may not really be necessary for this design.
    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, 1fr);

    3.2 - This produces 8 equally sized columns, with the first row to occupy 80% of the viewport height.
    This is actually not what we want because these columns constantly adapt their width to the viewport. 
    Have in mind that these eight columns represent the center of the website and we are making the desktop version, where we usually use something between 1100px and 1200 px (remember trillo with a max-width of 120rem).
    It still is quite small, but remember that we are going to add more stuff.
    This time we use 1140px, so divided by 8 is 142px that we round to 14rem.
    However, now they don't respond in width at all, because, of course this is a fixed width, which means that we have to use the minmax function.
    We really need to think here, we want these columns to have a width that is between the minimum content and the maximum of 14 rem, not the other way around.
    We want them to be 14rem but they can be smaller, but not smaller then the minimum content. This would be easier to see if we had content, but keep in mind this reasoning (we want them to be x size but they can either be wider or smaller)

    grid-template-columns: repeat(8, minmax(min-content, 14rem));

    3.3 - Now we add the sidebar, which is also a column with 8rem.
    grid-template-columns: 8rem repeat(8, minmax(min-content, 14rem));

    3.4 - NOTE - At this point we have the sidebar column with a fixed width and the eight columns with a minmax width.
    We need two things, to center the 8 columns between the end of the viewport and the sidebar (remember that the content is not centered in the viewport) and to fill the entire viewport (remember that these 8 columns and the sidebar have a "fixed width").
    The solution for this is to add two more columns, each occupying a fraction of the available space.

    grid-template-columns: 8rem 1fr repeat(8, minmax(min-content, 14rem) 1fr);

    Now we have our sidebar, the stretcher, the 8 columns and the final stretcher.

    Note that, if we didn't have the sidebar, we could just use the margin 0 auto trick to center all of this in the body or use the justify content property.

    Another reason why we want to do it like this is because we have full bleed sections like the story or the header. 

    These sections do not only occupy the 8 sections in the middle, they occupy the other two columns

  ///////////////////////////////////////////////

Now, in order to make our lives easier, let's name the column tracks. Naming the columns is always more important, in most cases we don't even want to size the rows, we just want them to assume the size of the content.

Pay attention on how things are done:
    - The sidebar-end is also the full-bleed start; the full bleed end is the last line.

    - The center start are the 8 columns with the center end at the end and we create a set of named lines for each one of them.
    8 col-starts and 8 col-end

grid-template-columns:
    [sidebar-start] 8rem [sidebar-end full-start] 1fr [center-start] repeat(
      8,
      [col-start] minmax(min-content, 14rem) [col-end]
    )
    [center-end]
    1fr [full-end];

As for the positioning, only the full bleed section are a bit tricky. 

The header and the realtors occupy the same line, the realtors have the last two of the height columns and the stretcher; and the header has the rest.

HEADER - it could be the col-start 7, but since this is what it marks the end of the header we use the end.

grid-column: full-start / col-end 6;

REALTORS
grid-column: col-start 7 / full-end;
Now we use the start because it is where the realtors start

1. Notice that we didn't specify the columns.

2. This lesson ends with the fact that, when we approach the size of the 8 columns, the stretchers almost disappear. 
This is exactly what we've told them to do because those columns occupy 1fr of the available space, if there is no space, they collapse.
But we don't want that behavior, we usually want some margin between the content and the margin of the page for when we shrink.
For this we use the minmax function again in order to maintain a minimum of 6rem (60px)
REMEMBER that this is done thinking in the center sections (the ones that are aligned to those eight columns) 

///////////////////////////////////////////////

Now we start to build the sections. 
FEATURES.

1. How and why to create grids inside of grids.
REMEMBER the possibility of using subgrid instead of creating them manually.
grid-template-columns: subgrid;

About the rows, we could define them with auto auto, but this is what is going to happen anyway when out items are placed inside the implicit grid.

After setting the grid to 3 cols and the gap, we fill the content. We have an svg that comes from an icon sprite that is already in the img folder, the heading (h4) and the paragraph. 
For the headings we use a different font-family than for the normal text.

2. After styling the content it's time to place it in the layout. For this of course we use again a grid. So .feature will, at this point become a grid container and not just a grid item.
One column for the svg, we already know its size but it is always better to set to auto or min-content, if we later change something it is already set to be the minimum size to fit the content.
Once again we don't define the rows. The content defines the rows.
There is something important when not defining the rows, when we try to span an element across a row, the -1 does not work, because we did not define the row itself, so that number does not make much sense. This shorthand only works for explicit grids.
grid-row: 1 / -1;
Instead we do 

3. Remember the trick when we where setting the icons to expand across the rows so that the height of the second column was defined by the h4 in the first row. lesson 109 min 10.
It makes sense because the paragraph is below the icon in the second row, we could move it to where we want but, since the icon is still in the first row only, the height of that entire row is defined by it. 
If we set the icon to occupy all the rows, the text is moved and the height of the first line is now defined by the h4.

4. To move the icon a bit to the top, we just need to use translate in y.
transform: translate(-1rem, 5rem); in both y and x

5. Seems common for the row gap to be less than the column gap in these components.
row-gap: 1.5rem;
column-gap: 2.5rem;
After doing so, you notice that the space between the h4 and the paragraph is much bigger in the components that have less text.
This happens because the parent grid, the .features grid, which contains these 6 items makes it so the items fill the entire cells. It is the same as saying that the align-items is set to stretch by default.
So, in order for the space to be even, we set it to start.
align-items: start;

6. Now, if we decrease the width of the page, we see that we need to make it responsive in order to, at some point, collapse a column and add a row.
REVIEW auto-fit and auto-fill.
For this we need to define some new column tracks with auto-fit (it simply creates as many tracks as can fit based on the width that we define, collapsing the ones that are empty). 
Collapsing means extra space, so it is perfect for using the minmax function.
grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(25rem, 1fr)); 25 rem is established by experimentation.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
STORY SECTION

CONTENT
In this section we start with the story content. In there we have an h2, an h3, text and a button.

In the code, the layout is both done with grid and flexbox.

PICTURES

The pictures container is a grid with a background image where we place the other two images on top.
The grid is going to be 6x6 because we have a background image that we also want to see. So the first and last column, the first and last row are to show that background.
Like this we have now four columns and four rows for the image in the center. 4/6 of the overall container is for the image in the center, and 2/3 (one third) is the remaining space.
There must many ways to see the number of columns that we need in these cases, but seems to me that what it actually defines them is the background image, that is what set the minimum size of the columns. 
There must be a better explanation for this, maybe in the gallery is possible to see. Te more accurate our positioning must be, the higher the number of columns we must have. 
Here we just have 3, so 6 by 6 must be enough.
grid-template-rows: repeat(6, 1fr);
grid-template-columns: repeat(6, 1fr);
Also notice that after we define the tracks, the images are now in different cells and occupy 100% of their width.

&__img--1 {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100%;
    grid-row: 2 / 6;
    grid-column: 2 / 6;
  }

After positioning the first image in the lines, we notice that it does not occupy the entire area that we've set. Normally we just set the width of the image so that the height is calculated according with the aspect ratio.

1. Why images are special and behave differently than other grid items.
Normally, regular grid items (any div) would fill up their entire grid area. Images do not behave like that because they have an intrinsic aspect (dimensions) ratio associated with them.
The images always try to maintain the aspect ration that is related with their dimensions, even with the align items property set by default to stretch as we know.
The solution for this is never to mess with the width, otherwise we ruin the aspect ratio, but if we want the image to be vertically aligned we use align items to center in the grid container.
Like this they occupy the entire width of the area but maintain the aspect ratio.

As for the second image, we know that we need to move it a bit for the right. We could use a simple translate on the x and move it, however the start would be moved away from the center also, the same would happen if we scaled the image. 
The best solution is to increase the width of the image in order to occupy a bit more than 100% and then set the z-index to something higher.

3. The third image is a background-image, so don't FORGET that it is not in the html, so the path origin is the style.css, meaning that we must go one level from there in order to enter the images folder.
background-image: url(../img/back.jpg);

After this we just need to apply some overlay because the colors of the image don't actually fit in our style. We need rgba for the alpha.
background-image: linear-gradient(
        rgba($color-primary, 0.5),
        rgba($color-primary, 0.5)
      ),
      url(../img/back.jpg);

1. How to deal with overlapping grid items.


3. How to decide if flexbox is a better tool in certain situations.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
HOMES SECTION


Here the technique is quite similar to the features component. We want the number of columns auto-fit, as many as they can fit in the container within a min of 25px and a max of 1fr to be responsive.

After the overall container is set and the markup for each card in done, we can notice that the example has a grid with two columns.

As for the rows, we can let css set them automatically. One more time we can see that it is more frequent to just define the columns, if we set them to be responsive, the rows are implicitly created.

1. How to build a complex component using a mix of css grid properties, overlapping and flexbox.

  1.1 - This part refers to the placing of the heart icon to the upper right corner of the image. We start by moving the element into that grid cell.
    &__like {
    grid-column: 2 / 3;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
    height: 2.5rem;
    width: 2.5rem;
    fill: $color-primary;
  }
  With this it actually moved correctly, but since we didn't specify the row in the image, it came to the second one. So we need to specify each time that we want one or more elements in one grid cell.
      &__img {
    width: 100%;
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
  }

  To make sure that the heart will always be on top of the image, we give both a z-index and place the heart to the end of the grid cell horizontally.
  justify-self: end;

  1.2 - Now for the name of the house, we know it does not occupy 100% of the width of the parent, so we set it to 80%.
  To to center horizontally we use justify-self. 
  In order to move it in the column axis (y) we have two options, we can either use translate and move the element -50% in the y, which leaves us half of a row empty OR we can move the element into the first row and overlap the details.

&__name {
    font-family: $font-display;
    font-size: 1.6rem;
    text-align: center;
    padding: 1.25rem;
    background-color: $color-secondary;
    color: $color-white;
    font-weight: 400;
    width: 80%;
    grid-column: 1 / -1;
    grid-row: 1 / 2;
    z-index: 3;
    justify-self: center;
    align-self: end;
    transform: translateY(50%);
  }

  Moving the element to the first line and then translate it is a better solution, because when we add the gap its reference to move in the y axis is the first row. 
  We always need to find a way around to make the gaps adequate in both cases, but like this is easier.
  In our case, the solution is to add some margin to the top of the location and the rooms, so that the space stays more even
     &__location,
     &__rooms {
    margin-top: 2.5rem;
  }

  The location, rooms, area and price should be placed side by side, so we use flex.
      
    &__location,
  &__rooms,
  &__area,
  &__price {
    font-size: 1.5rem;
    margin-left: 2rem;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;

    svg {
      height: 2rem;
      width: 2rem;
      fill: $color-primary;
      margin-right: 1rem;
    }

    // We don't need the paragraph because the font-size get's inherited from the rule above.
  }

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
GALLERY SECTION

1. How to create a complex grid-looking gallery.

When creating a grid structure like this, how are we going to select the number of row and column tracks? 

  1.1 - The most important thing to consider is the smallest unit that we want to have in our grid. 
  That cell is what is going to define the width of the columns and the height of the rows.

  Building the layout always comes through experimentation, we may start with 12 columns and 12 rows but then change to something with less tracks.

  THE BUILD PROCESS
  -- We start with just one image.
      <section class="gallery">
      <img src="img/gal-1.jpeg" alt="Gallery image 1" class="gallery__img" />
    </section>

  -- Then we work on the gallery file. We already know that we have 8 equally columns with 1fr. However, as for the rows. we know that they are 7 but how about their height? 
  If we decrease the viewport, we can see that the cells maintain the aspect ratio perfectly. This means that the height is tied to the viewport width.
  After trial and error, 5% of the viewport's width is the perfect size for the height.
  The main difficulty is to know why this measure is optimal and why we might affect the aspect ratio of the images.


2. Using object-fit together with images for grid-items.
In order to use object-fit we need to specify the height and the width of the image, setting it to cover allows us to maintain the aspect ratio.
He used a figure to contain the image, but it must be for semantics, although the figure becomes the grid item we just use it's class to position the image in the grid. 
The display set to block on the images is to remove the space that gets added to all inline images (treated as text).

Couldn't quite understand the use of the gallery__item class. We could do gallery__item--1 straightforward.


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
FOOTER SECTION
Here we just have a one dimensional component, so we could have used flexbox, however, working with grids makes the spacing a lot easier.
With flexbox we would have to add margin right to all except for the last one, with grid we just need the gap.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
SIDEBAR SECTION
We are just going to create the button, it starts with the button element with no content, than it is the before and after pseudo elements that work the magic.

Both the before and after have the same rules as the button, but we move one up and one down.
Then we center it with flexbox in the sidebar container

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
HEADER SECTION

1. How to manage vertical spacing in a responsive layout using CSS grid techniques.

The main thing to keep in mind in this section is the fact that this section have a fixed height of 80% of the viewport that we've established in the base.

Having a fixed height means that we can set the rows with fr units (occupy all the available space).
This is the main technique that we are going to use to manage the vertical space.
This is a component that can be compared with the stories content, they are both one row grids but is the stories we used margins to add space between the rows. However, when we decrease the viewport those margins are maintained.

  1.1 - We start by setting the first row to occupy 1fr in order to push all the other elements down, like this, all the other rows will be sized automatically.

  1.2 - In order to add some space between them we use the gap. This time we only have one column, so using the row-gap property is better.
  As we know, we cannot really style the gaps, so, in order to give some space after some row, we need to increase the row size.
  In the section stories we added margin to solve this problem with the rows set to auto(auto outside of a min-max function is min-content - allows wrapping).
  Now, say that we want to add some space between the 3rd and the 4th row (h1 and the button), we use min-content on the second and add a fixed height on the third instead of a margin.
    grid-template-rows: 1fr min-content 6rem 1fr;

  1.2 - Again we need to use a modifier to the button to justify and align it.
    &__btn {
    align-self: start;
    justify-self: start;
  }

  1.3 - Now for the seen on logos, we are also use a grid to position these icons. It is much easier than use flexbox because we avoid using the margin right in all except the last one.
  We create 4 equally sized columns and the justify-items to center.
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    column-gap: 3rem;
    justify-items: center;

  To make the images darker we use a filter:
  filter: brightness(70%);


2. How to use ::before and ::after as grid items.
As for the seen on text we are also going to use a grid. Although we don't even have grid items, setting the display to grid makes it so that even text can be treated as a grid item, also, pseudo elements can also be treated as grid items.

  2.1 - After we set the before and after pseudo elements we can see that the grid now have more lines (4). By default, CSS always places the it's items in rows, but we want columns of course. In this case we want to size the columns, but don't forget that if we want the grid to add the items in columns instead of rows we use grid-auto-flow: column;
  We want 1fr max-content 1fr
  &__seenon-text {
    font-size: 1.6rem;
    color: $color-grey-light-2;
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr max-content 1fr;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    column-gap: 1.5rem;


////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
REALTORS SECTION

The difference between the realtors and the header is that, in the header, we declared the entire head element as the grid container. In the realtors we will have the grid inside of a container because we don't want the h3 inside of the grid.

The row gap is set to 5% of the viewport height because if we set it to a fixed height it's gonna be bad in huge viewport's. 5% seems to be the rule of thumb.

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
 
MEDIA QUERIES

1. The first thing that we notice is that, in the header, the content starts overflowing other parts. 
This happens because we set the height of the images(icons from the companies) to the fixed value of 2.5rem.
To fix this problem we need to use a responsive unit. We use max-height to say that it is 2.5rem but can be less and we also need to specify the width with the same technique, saying that it can be 100% but it can be less, otherwise it will not scale properly.

This is not enough though, as we know, we set the column of the header to have the width of max-content, so it does not wrap.
To fix this we need to use the minmax function
 grid-template-columns: minmax(min-content, max-content);
Other problems where created, the logos do not have the same size, so one start to shrink before others, we need to align them vertically.
The other problem is that we've specified a fixed height to the h1 row. Again we use minmax but, now the max is the min content.
grid-template-rows: 1fr min-content minmax(6rem, min-content) 1fr;

2. There are some problems that can be fixed with this resetting of units in the rows or columns, but others require media queries.
For this, we are going to use the same technique of decreasing the viewport and make changes at the width that is necessary.

    2.1 - At 1200px everything starts to be a bit crammed, so it's time to decrease the font-size to buy us some more space.

    2.2 - At 1000px, everything looks good, but we start to have less space in the realtors, so we can change the sidebar.
    This is also where we see the power of grids, to move the sidebar to the top we just need to change the grid definitions.

    2.3 - In the third media query we will place the realtors after the header and also the story one after another.
    First we create a new row after the header with the calc function.
    The header just needs to change the columns 1 / -1.
    The realtors get pushed to the correct line so we also expand it.
    The tricky part was to make them side by side, as it seems obvious we need more columns if we just want a row. The sizing remains the same, min for the photo and max for the details.

    As for the story,

////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

THINGS TO TAKE

1. He does not use any type of architecture, only one file for each section/part of the page. Although it would be better to use the 7-1 pattern, keep in mind that it is not so confusing to do it like this in the beginning.
Only after one section is made we can move the code to where it belongs.

2. Placeholder, extend vs mixins. IMPORTANT - to review.
With the extend, it is like the heading is copied into the %heading selector (this is why we call it placeholder, imagine the .heading-1 replacing the %heading).

%heading {
  font-family: $font-display;
  font-weight: 400;
}

.heading-1 {
  @extend %heading;
}

This is actually what happens, look how the css code stays:
.heading-4, .heading-3, .heading-2, .heading-1 {
  font-family: "Josefin Sans", sans-serif;
  font-weight: 400;
}

With mixins it works the other way around, the code would be pasted into each of these selectors.

3. Where and how to use min-content, max-content, auto-fit, auto-fill, minmax function. When doing the media queries, some problems can be fixed with the minmax function for sizing the rows and the columns. Remember that we wanted the h1 to be max-content as the max width, but the min should be min-content in order to allow wrapping when decreasing the viewport.
Also for the rows, when we want some space between a row and another we set a fixed height, but when we decrease the viewport and the content wraps we what it to be min-content.

4. Helper classes so that the values are not hardcoded on the reusable components. Like this we just add them with margins for ex in the html.

5. Padding with vh and vw, remember that when collapsing the screen the story content left and right margin became too big, so we set vw. As for top and bottom, seems to me that it changes with media queries. Would it be plausible to also set vh?

6. <p>325 m<sup>2</sup></p>

7. How to build galleries, meaning how do we know how to set the height of the rows in order to maintain the aspect ratio. Also see images as grid items. Why use figure element, does object fit resolves the problem?

8. Both in the gallery and the footer there is a class that it is never used. It is the one common to all the items. Why? Good practice, are they just the container? javascript?

9. How to hover the button that we've created in the sidebar.

10. Creating an overlay with a background image, setting the image to cover and its position to center
  background-image: linear-gradient(
      rgba($color-secondary, 0.93),
      rgba($color-secondary, 0.93)
    ),
    url(../img/hero.jpeg);

  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;

11. Filter to make images darker, among other things.

12. 
Desktop first approach uses max-width because applies changes below the max-width.

If something is not right at a certain width, he does the media query at 100px more. The last point where it still looks good.

Regular breakpoints: 1200px (75em)
                     1000px (62.5em) not so common

Regular font-size changes: 62.5% - 1rem - 10px
                           50% - 1rem - 8px

13. The property where we set the beginning of a rotate or a translate. It is when we built a button with pseudo elements somewhere in the course.

14. Shorthand for the grid template rows and columns is grid-template: rows / columns;
 -->
