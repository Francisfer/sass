/* ANIMATIONS */

/* Generally, there are two types of animations in css. The first one (easier) is to use the transition property and change the properties that we want to animate on an event (hover) */

/* The other is to use the keyframes @ rule */

/* We are going to start with the outdoors (heading-primary-main) that moves from the left */

/* IMPORTANT - For browser performance is better to only ever animate two different properties: the opacity and the transform */

/* For an animation to work, there are only two properties that we have to REALLY specify: ANIMATION NAME and ANIMATION DURATION (on the element that we want to animate) */
/* The others are animation delay (before it starts), animation-iteration-count (happens n times) and animation-timing-function */

/* In the course, after the animation there is a slight shake of the entire box upwards, it doesn't happen in my case but the fix is with the backface-visibility: hidden on the h1 */
/* This property is used to set if the back part on an element is visible to the user when we transform it  */

  /* REMEMBER that until this point the only problem was that the button appeared when the page was rendered and only after the animation took place */

/* 

Things to take:

1. Inline elements are treated as text
2. The transform is one of them most important properties
3. The y axis moves from the top to the bottom, so up gets negative values.
4. Transition: all seconds - to animate the states




SLIDES - UNITS CONVERTED FROM RELATIVE TO ABSOLUTE (PX).

1. Distinction between using percentages for fonts or for length (distance measurements)
    1.1 - If we define a declaration that sets the font size to 150% (in the header for ex), that means that the element will have a font size  150% larger than its parent element (remember 16 px root), so 24px.

    1.2 - For length set in percentages it works a bit different. Height, padding, margin or something else that is a distance, the reference is ALWAYS the parents element width. So if the parent element has a width of 1000px and we set the padding of the child element to 10%, that means it gets 100px of padding.

2. Font-based relative units - em, rem. Again, it is different to use em or rem for fonts or for length. BOTH em and rem are font-based, the difference is that em use the parent or the current element as a reference WHILE rems use the root (html) font-size as the reference.

  em are similar to percentages and
