<!-- Advanced responsive design -->
<!-- Two approaches, desktop first and mobile first, we are going with desktop first because it is easier to learn and we do that by writing media queries that test for max width. -->

<!-- When we have conflicting rules in media queries, for example a phone that has 500 px get's the media query for 600px and the media query for 900px because, in both cases 500 < 600 && 500 < 900  -->

<!-- In this case the last rule that it's written in the code gets applied, that's why the order of the code is important in this case. -->

<!-- There are several ways of establishing the breakpoints, the bad (having in account the screen sizes of some brand, apple for ex), the good (in which we choose the screen sizes that are most used, we can get this data from gs.statcounter.com/screen-resolution) and the perfect (we write media queries whenever our code breaks as we diminish the window, of course this in not easy because we can rapidly end up with many queries) -->

<!-- Usualy, we need one breakpoint for phones, one for portrait tablets, one for landscape tablets and one for the desktop -->

<!-- The best strategy for responsive design with scss is to use mixins. -->

<!-- 
Ranges:

0-600px:      Phone

600-900:      Tablet portrait

900-1200:     Tablet landscape

[1200 - 1800] this is where our normal styles apply

1800 + :      Big desktop, for this we will write a min width media query of course.

 -->

<!-- 
  See how to pass arguments with mixins and blocks of code using @content.
  -->

<!-- sizzy.co to test the media queries on different devices after the site in online -->

<!-- RESPONSIVE IMAGES -->

<!-- At this point we have flexible images, images that scale with the viewport width, but responsive images take things to a hole new level -->

<!-- The goal of responsive images is to serve the rigth image to the right screen size and device, in order to avoid downloading unnecessary large images on smaller screens -->

<!-- In css we work with background images and in html we work with images that have a tag img, where we specify a source -->

<!-- In html we are going to do desity switching and art direction. The philosophy behind densitiy switching is to serve a larger version of the same image for high resolution screens and a smaller version for a low resolution screen -->
<!-- As for the art direction, we want to tell the browser to use one image on one screen width and another on another width. To make images depend on the screen width we use an html element called picture -->

<!-- Density and resolution switching aproach. Unlike in art direction, where we force the browser to use a certain image according to a media query, here we allow the browser to choose the best image for the current viewport and pixel density of the user's screen. -->

<!-- Check the css to see how responsive background images are worked, we just worked on the header-->

<!-- CAN I USE TO SEE THE PROPERTIES THAT ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE IN THE DIFFERENT BROWSERS -->
