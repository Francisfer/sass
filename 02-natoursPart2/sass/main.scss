// ARCHITECTURE - creating the folders inside of the sass folder
//////////////////////////////////////////////////

// - The 7-1 folder pattern.

// BASE - For the real low level basics such as resets and styles for the html and body element selectors.
// This file should be a partial, so we can later import it into the main sass file. Partials are written with a starting _

// COMPONENTS - where we have one file for each component, remember that the components are the reusable building blocks that make up the app or the website.
// They also should be usable anywhere on the page, so that they are completely independent and held together by the layout of the page.

// LAYOUT - where we have the overall layout of the project, for each peace of the global layout of the entire project. global footer, global header, etc.

// PAGES - styles for specific pages of the project (very specific styles for a very specific page - like a homepage)

// THEMES - if we want to implement different visual themes(a web app with different themes). EMPTY IN THIS PROJECT

// ABSTRACTS - where we put code that don't output any css (variables, mixins, functions)

// VENDORS - third party css goes, from bootstrap, an icon system or an animation framework. EMPTY IN THIS PROJECT
